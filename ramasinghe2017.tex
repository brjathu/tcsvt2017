% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  %\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{./figures/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
 \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
 \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{amsmath}


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***

\subsection{Motion Features}
\subsubsection{Clustering}
In order to isolate each sub area in a frame, which contains significant movement, DBScan clustering is applied on dense trajectory points.
Our clustering algorithm is illustrated in the psudocode in figure. We use 8 and 10 as epsilon and minpoint parameters.



\begin{algorithm}
   \caption{Clustering algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \Function{dbScan}{$Dataset, epsilon, MinPoints$}
        \State $Cluster = 0$
        \For{$each$ $P$ in $Dataset$}
	  \If{$P$ is $visited$}
	    \State{$continue$}
	  \EndIf
            \State mark $P$ as $visited$
            \State $NeighborPts = getAllPoints(P, epsilon)$
          \If{$size(NeighborPts) < MinPoints$}
          \State{mark $P$ as $NOISE$}
          \Else
          \State{$Cluster$ = next cluster}
          \State{$addToCluster(P, NeighborPts, Cluster, epsilon, MinPoints)$}
          \EndIf
        \EndFor
       \EndFunction
       
       \Function{addToCluster}{$P, NeighborPts, Cluster, epsilon, MinPoints$}
	\State $add P to cluster Cluster$
	\For{$each$ $point$ $np$ in $NeighborPts$}
	  \If{$P$ is $not$ $visited$}
	    \State $mark$ $np$ as $visited$
	    \State $NeighborPts' = getAllPoints(np, epsilon)$
	    \If {$size(NeighborPts') >= MinPoints$}
            \State $NeighborPts = NeighborPts joined with NeighborPts'$
            \EndIf
	    
	  \EndIf
	  \If{$np$ is $not$ yet member of any cluster}
         \State $add$ $np$ to cluster $Cluster$
         \EndIf
	\EndFor
       \EndFunction
       
       \Function{getAllPoints}{$P, epsilon$}
       \State $return$ all points within $P$'s $epsilon$-neighborhood (including $P$)
       \EndFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


Eventhough there are many regions, which contain motion, in a video, some are not significant, nor discriptive.
Those moving regions can be neglected without loss of performance.
In order to achieve this, after clustering each trajectory point in to cluster groups, non-significant cluster groups are removed from consideration.
This is done, in order to
prevent the algorithm focusing on small random moving areas in a video, and to only create motion tubes along areas, which are significant and discriptive.
Therefore, all the clusters, which are not atleast 50\% of the largest cluster of the frame, are discarded.

After identifying the initial candidate clusters, for creating motion tubes, further processing is done to each cluster to ensure that they 
contain only the important moving areas, according to the algorithm in figure. For each point, the chebychev distance from the centroid is calculated,
and, furthest 20\% of the points, with respect to the total number of points, are discarded from the cluster. The reason behind the choice of chebychev 
distance, over euclidian distance, is that, a symmetric square shaped cluster groups are obtained, rather than a circle. Which makes it
easier to track moving areas, and create motion tubes. 

\begin{equation}
 D_{chebychev} = max(|X_{2} - X_{1}|,|Y_{2}-Y_{1}|)
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
   \caption{}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Function{formatCluster}{$inCluster, maxChebichevDistance$}
	\State {$maxD_{chebichev}$ = $maxChebichevDistance$}
	\State {$totalPoints$ = $getTotalPoints(inCluster, maxD_{chebichev})$}
	\State $currentPoints$ = $totalPoints$
	\While{$true$}
	  \If{$number_of_count_currentPoints<number_of_count_totalPoints*80/100$}
	    \State return $all the points bellong to currentPoints$
	  \EndIf
	  \State {$maxD_{chebichev}$ = $maxD_{chebichev}$ - 1}
	  \State {$currentPoints$ = $getTotalPoints(inCluster, maxD_{chebichev})$}
	  
	\EndWhile
     \EndFunction

     
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

After identifying square shaped interest regions (action boxes), each of them is represented with a vector $b = (x,y,r)$, where, $x,y$ are the coordinates
of the top left corner of the box and $r$ is the hight/width of the box. 


\subsubsection{Motion Tubes}
Since our work models the time evolution of activities, within a video, we divide each input video $V_{i}$ into temporal segments $V_{i} = [v_{i,1},
v_{i,2},.....v_{i,n}]$,
and create features for each individual segment seperately. Therefore, after creating the action boxes for each video segment,
the action boxes within a segment $V_{i}$ can be represented as per equation, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\MoveEqLeft
 f(V_{i}) = \big\{[b_{i,1,1},b_{i,1,2},...,b_{i,1,q}],\\
 & [b_{i,2,1},b_{i,2,2},...,b_{i,2,p}],...,[b_{i,n,1},b_{i,n,2},...,b_{i,n,k}]\big\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $b_{i,j,k}$ is the $k^{th}$ action box in $j^{th}$ frame of the $i^{th}$ video segment. Note that the number of
action boxes diffe from frame to frame.

Therfore, Before linking the action boxes to create motion tubes, further pre processing is needed to ensure same number of action
boxes exists in every frame, within a video segment. Otherwise, motion tubes could become joined halfway though the video, and capturing
dynamics of each moving object seperately, is disturbed. 

Therefore, mean action box number per a frame
is calculated. And we iterate through each frame, until we come to a frame, which has the mean number action boxes.

Then from that frame, we propagate forward and back along the frames, to eliminate, or add action boxes.

If the action box count in a particular frame, is larger than the previous frame, the excess number of action boxes are removed, 
in the decending order of the size of the action box.
If the case, where action box count is lower than the previous frame, linear regression for each value $x,y and r$ of vector $b = (x,y,r)$,
up to that frame, is used to create artificial action boxes, until the number of action boxes match the mean number of action boxes, as follows.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    Y_{1}     \\
    Y_{2}     \\
    \hdotsfor{1} \\
    Y_{n}     
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & X_{1}     \\
    1 & X_{2}     \\
    \hdotsfor{2} \\
    1 & X_{n}     
\end{bmatrix}
*
\begin{bmatrix}
    \beta_{0}     \\
    \beta_{1}      
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
    \epsilon_{1}     \\
    \epsilon_{2}    \\
    \hdotsfor{1} \\
    \epsilon_{n}    
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where, $X$ may be $x,y$ or $r$. Then least square method is used to predict. Note that $n$ increases as the observed action boxes
increases, hence the prediction becomes more accurate. Note after this processing, equation 3 is transformed in to equation 4, 
which illustrates that the number of action boxes per frame is equal for all the frames within a video segment. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\MoveEqLeft
 f(V_{i}) = \big\{[b_{i,1,1},b_{i,1,2},...,b_{i,1,k}],\\
 & [b_{i,2,1},b_{i,2,2},...,b_{i,2,k}],...,[b_{i,n,1},b_{i,n,2},...,b_{i,n,k}]\big\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


The following procedure
is used to link the action boxes within consequetive frames.

Assume $b_{t,1}$, $b_{t,2}$,...,$b_{t,k}$ and $b_{t+1,1}$, $b_{t+1,2}$,...,$b_{t+1,k}$  are action boxes in two 
consequetive frames at time $t,t+1$. Then, following distance matrix is caculated.


\[
D=\begin{bmatrix}
    D_{11}       & D_{12} & D_{13} & \dots & D_{1k} \\
    D_{21}       & D_{22} & D_{23} & \dots & D_{2k} \\
    \hdotsfor{5} \\
    D_{k1}       & D_{k2} & D_{k3} & \dots & D_{kk}
\end{bmatrix}
\]


Where, $D_{i,j}$ is the euclidian distance, between the centroids of $i^{th}$ action box in $t^{th}$ frame and $j^{th}$ action box in $(t+1)^{th}$ frame. 
Then, $u^{th}$ action box at $t+1$, and $1_{st}$ action box at $t$ is linked, where $u$ is calculated using,


\begin{equation}
u=\underset{j\in J}{argmin_j}\{D_{1,j}\}, J=\{1,2,...,l\}
\end{equation}

Then, the $1_{st}$ row and the $j_{th}$ column is removed from the distance matrix, and the same process is applied repeatedly
to link each of the action boxes at $t$ with $t+1$. By this removal process, we avoid combining of motion tubes in half-way through 
the video segment, and keep them isolated from each other, which is vital to capture the dynamics seperately, for each moving object.




Finally, we create matrix $M_{i}$ which encodes all the information in equation

\[
M=\begin{bmatrix}
    1       & 1 & x_{1,1} & y_{1,1} & r_{1,1} \\
    1       & 2 & x_{1,2} & y_{1,2} & r_{1,2} \\
    \hdotsfor{5} \\
    1       & n & x_{1,n} & y_{1,n} & r_{1,n} \\
    2       & 1 & x_{2,1} & y_{2,1} & r_{2,1} \\
    2       & 2 & x_{2,2} & y_{2,2} & r_{2,2} \\
    \hdotsfor{5} \\
    2       & n & x_{2,n} & y_{2,n} & r_{2,n} \\
    \hdotsfor{5} \\
    z       & 1 & x_{z,1} & y_{z,1} & r_{z,1} \\
    z       & 2 & x_{z,2} & y_{z,2} & r_{z,2} \\
    \hdotsfor{5} \\
    z       & n & x_{z,n} & y_{z,n} & r_{z,n} \\
    
\end{bmatrix}
\]


\subsubsection{Histogram Oriented Optic Flows - HOOF}
After identifying the $k$ number of motion tubes (n is a variable) for each video segment $v_{i,n}$, the optic flows along each motion tube,
, are calculated, using Lucas et.al. After that, Histogram-Oriented-Optic-Flows, for each motion tube is created. We create HOOFs for every
sub-frame within a motion tube. Each flow vector within a spatio-temporal sub-frame within a motion tube, is binned according
to its primary angle from the horizontal axis and weighted according to its magnitude.  Thus, all optical flow vectors, $v=[x,y]^T$ with direction,
$\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{y})$ in the range,

\begin{equation}
- \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi\frac{b-1}{B} \leq \theta < -\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi\frac{b}{B}
\end{equation}

will contribute by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ to the sum in bin $b$, $1 \leq b \leq B$ out of a total of
$B$, bins. Finally, the histogram is normalized to sum up to 1. We choose 100 as the bin number.

\subsubsection{Bag of HOOFs}
We use a bag of features method to create a motion discriptor for each video segment. First, we create a code book for HOOF vectors. 
All the HOOF vectors of all the video segments in all video classes are clustered using k-means clustering, and 1000 cluster heads
are identified. We choose the number of cluster heads as 1000, because, the dimensions final motion discriptors are needed to be same as
static discriptors, which is explained later. Then for each video segment $v_{i}$. a histogram is calculated using 

\begin{equation}
\forall k \in \big\{1,2,......n\big\}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
H(p)_{i} = H(p)_{i}+1
\end{equation}

where $H_{i}(p)$ is the $p^{th}$ value of histogram of video segment $v_{i}$, and

\begin{equation}
p = argmin_{j}(Thf_{j}-hf_{i,k})
\end{equation}

This $H = [H_{1},H_{2},.......H_{n}]$ is the vector time series, which encodes the time evolution of motion information, in the video.

\subsection{Static Features}

In order to create static discriptors, we create a CNN of 1000 output classes, and train it on image-net dataset. The architecture is shown in figure.
After 30 epochs, the training is stopped and used on each individual frame of each video segement. Then, the output vectors of the CNN,
are averaged 
along indexes, and a static discritor $s_{i}$ is obtained foe each video segment $v_{i}$. Following the 
procidure for every $v_{i}$, finally, we have a vector time series 
$S =[s_{1}, s_{2},...s_{n}]$, representing the static time evolution of the whole video.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

%\end{tabular}

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
